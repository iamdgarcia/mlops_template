## 🔄 Workflow Overview

### Continuous Integration (CI)
Every code push triggers automated testing:
- Security scans
- Code quality checks
- Unit tests

**No model training, no deployment** - just fast feedback (~2-3 minutes)

### Model Retraining (Manual)
Train and deploy models on-demand:
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Select "Model Retraining & Deployment"
3. Choose environment (dev/staging/prod)
4. Trigger workflow

**Complete flow**: Data pipeline → Training → Git commit → Auto-deploy

### Drift Monitoring (Daily)
Automatic drift detection:
- Runs daily at 2 AM UTC
- Creates GitHub issues on drift
- Includes retraining instructions
