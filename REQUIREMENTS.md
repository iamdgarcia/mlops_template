# DEPRECATED — REQUIREMENTS.md

This file has been deprecated and its contents have been replaced by `requirements.txt`.

Reason:
- The project maintains a single machine-readable `requirements.txt` used for installations and CI.
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` duplicated dependency information and caused drift with the canonical file.

Action:
- This document is intentionally left as a deprecation notice. The file will be removed from the repository in the next commit (to keep a clear history and avoid accidental re-introduction).

Source of truth for Python dependencies:
- `requirements.txt`

If you need a human-readable summary of dependencies, open an issue or refer to `REQUIREMENTS.md` in the repository history (git) for the previous contents.
